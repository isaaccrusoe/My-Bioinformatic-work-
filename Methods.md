# Methods

## Protein Selection
The protein **Glutathione transferase FosA** from *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (ATCC 15692) was selected due to its known role in fosfomycin resistance.

## Data Retrieval
- Protein sequence retrieved from **Ensembl**
- Functional annotations obtained from **UniProt**

## Structure Prediction
- 3D protein structure predicted using **AlphaFold**
- Confidence and folding quality assessed via AlphaFold metrics

## Visualization
- AlphaFold structure imported into **PyMOL**
- Structural features explored, rotated, and rendered
- High-quality images exported for analysis and presentation
