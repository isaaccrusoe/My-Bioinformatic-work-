# Exploring Bioinformatics to Understand Antimicrobial Resistance 🧬

## Project Overview
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major global health threat. Understanding resistance mechanisms at the molecular level is essential for developing effective interventions.

In this project, I analyzed **Glutathione transferase FosA**, a protein that confers resistance to **fosfomycin** by catalyzing the addition of glutathione to the drug. This enzyme is found in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (strain ATCC 15692), a clinically significant pathogen.

## Objectives
- Explore protein-based antimicrobial resistance mechanisms
- Analyze FosA protein sequence and annotations
- Predict and visualize 3D protein structure
- Strengthen practical bioinformatics skills

---

## Tools & Resources
- **Ensembl** – sequence retrieval  
- **UniProt** – protein annotation  
- **AlphaFold** – 3D structure prediction  
- **PyMOL** – molecular visualization  

---

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully predicted and visualized the FosA protein structure
- Identified functional regions relevant to fosfomycin resistance
- Gained hands-on experience in structural bioinformatics

---

## Why This Matters
Understanding protein structures involved in drug resistance helps explain *how* bacteria evade antibiotics and supports the One Health approach to combating AMR.
