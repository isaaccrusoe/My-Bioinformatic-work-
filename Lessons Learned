# Lessons Learned

- Bioinformatics bridges molecular biology and computational analysis
- Protein structure visualization enhances understanding beyond sequences
- AlphaFold is a powerful tool for hypothesis generation
- Visualization tools like PyMOL are essential for interpreting structure–function relationships
- AMR research benefits greatly from integrating structural biology

This project strengthened my confidence to independently explore bioinformatics tools and apply them to real-world AMR problems.
